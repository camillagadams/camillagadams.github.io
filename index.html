  <dt>The Minimum Wage, Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Market for Alternative Credit</dt>
  Exploiting variation in the timing of minimum wage increases and EITC state top-ups across states and time, I explore the effects of these two programs on the usage of non-traditional sources of credit such as payday loans, pawn shops and tax refund anticipation loans. For low-income households, I find that a ten percent increase in the minimum wage, approximately $0.75, leads to a 0.6 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of accessing alternative credit. This is against a mean usage rate of 6 percent. Meanwhile, increases in the EITC seem to have no effects on the usage of alternative credit. When focusing on households that have recently experienced an unexpected negative wealth event, the effects intensify substantially to a 2 percentage point reduction for a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage, while EITC effects remain negligible. The paper makes a case for previously unexplored welfare gains from minimum wage increases, by way of reduced usage of alternative credit.
